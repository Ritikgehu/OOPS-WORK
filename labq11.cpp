/*Imagine a tollbooth with a class called TollBooth. The two data items are of type unsigned int and double to hold the total number 
of cars and total amount of money collected. A constructor initializes both of these data members to 0. A member function called 
payingCar( )increments the car total and adds 0.5 to the cash total. Another function called nonPayCar( ) increments the car total 
but adds nothing to the cash total. Finally a member function called display( )shows the two totals. Include a program to test this 
class. This program should allow the user to push one key to count a paying car and another to count a non paying car. Pushing the 
ESC key should cause the program to print out the total number of cars and total cash and then exit.
